{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
This [G]is my [D]Father's [G]world,
and [C]to my [G]listening [D]ears
all [G]nature si[D]ngs, and [B/D#]round me [Em]rings
the [C]music o[D]f the s[G]pheres.
This [G]is my [C]Fath[D]er's [G]world,
I r[C]est me [D]in the [G]thought
of [G]rocks and [Em]trees, of [C]skies [D]and [G]seas;
his [C]hand the [D]wonders [G]wrought.

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
This [G]is my [D]Father's [G]world,
the [C]birds their [G]carols [D]raise,
the [G]morning l[D]ight, the[B/D#] lily [Em]white,
de[C]clare their [D]maker's p[G]raise.
This [G]is my [C]Fath[D]er's [G]world:
He [C]shines in [D]all that's [G]fair,
in [G]the [Em]rustling grass I [C]hear [D]Him [G]pass,
He [C]speaks to [D]me e[G]verywhere.

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
This [G]is my [D]Father's [G]world.
O [C]let me [G]ne'er [D]forget
that [G]though the w[D]rong seems [B/D#]oft so [Em]strong,
God [C]is the [D]ruler [G]yet.
This [G]is my [C]Fath[D]er's [G]world:
the [C]battle [D]is not [G]done:
Je[G]sus Who [Em]died shall be [C]sa--[D]tis[G]fied,
And [C]earth and [D]Heavâ€™n be [G]one.
